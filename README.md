# About
This is primarily a backup for my MPV config file, however it may be useful for others (hence why I am sharing it here).

The main goal is for efficient high quality playback of SDR and tone-mapped HDR content. This meanst as little post-processing done as possible.

# Notes
This config is currently only tested on Windows 10 -> HDR TV. Given some of the settings used, it is quite likely a dedicted GPU is required.
